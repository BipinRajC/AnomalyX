# AnomalyX: Adaptive Threat Detection in Network Ecosystems

_AnomalyX is an innovative network security framework designed to provide adaptive and near real-time threat detection using advanced machine learning techniques and time-series analytics._

## üîç Core Technology Fusion
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Powered by TimeGPT's predictive algorithms
- **Database Engine**: Fusion of Elasticsearch and InfluxDB for high-performance, real-time data ingestion in a time-series manner
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced anomaly detection with adaptive learning models like RNN, Pretrained Transformer by Nixtla Client and RAG
- **Visualization**: Dynamic, interactive dashboards by showing network threat landscapes using Python and Kibana

## üéØ Key Objectives  
- Advanced threat detection by developing an innovative network security framework that transcends traditional anomaly detection methodologies. Create a system capable of identifying sophisticated and dynamic network threats with unprecedented precision and speed.

- Utilization of InfluxDB to enable efficient time-series data storage, retrieval, and real-time analysis. Creation of a robust data ingestion pipeline that can handle complex network datasets from sources like CICIDS, KDD Cup 1999, and UNSW-NB15.

- Design of an intuitive, interactive dashboard that provides real-time visualization of network threats and anomalies. Creation of user-friendly interfaces that enable seamless data upload, comprehensive analysis, and threat exploration.
